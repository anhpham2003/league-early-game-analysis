## Introduction
League of Legends is a multiplayer strategy game where early decisions can shape the entire outcome of a match. Among the five roles on a team, the jungler has a unique impact on early momentum: they control neutral objective, apply pressure on every lane, and create advantages through early kills or assists. Because of this, the community often raise a debate how much early jungler activity actually influences the chances of wining.

This project investigates this question using professional League of Legends match data from 2014 to 2025. We examine whether early jungle involvement, measured by kills or assists within the first ten minutes, is linked to a higher chance of winning. By comparing win rates in games where the jungler, is active with at least one kill or assist at 10 minutes vs. inactive with zero kills/assists, we quantify the jungler's early impact and how early skirmishes shape a match.

This analysis uses exploratory data analysis, statistical testing, and visualization to determine whether early jungle success provides a real competitive advantage or if its importance is overstated compared to later objectives, team compositions, and macro decisions.
